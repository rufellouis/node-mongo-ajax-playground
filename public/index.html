    Very simple HTML5 'app' structure

    Assumes a public file structure as follows:

    /
        css
        js
            vendor
            vendor
            vendor
            vendor
            vendor

    For now the only files are:

        css/app.css - blank css file (add stuff as needed)
        js/app.js - our basic ajax interactions
        js/vendor - 3rd party javascripts (in this case jquery)

    In a large real life app or complex page you would try and load as many javascripts
    as possible at the bottom of the page for maximum page load speed.

    This helps because page rendering is paused whilst a javascript file is loaded. The DEFER tag
    can also be used to help avoid this but is not browser consistent.

    Other ways to 'fix' the problem include using asynchronous loader scripts such at the
    powerful and popular http://requirejs.org

    <script type="text/javascript" src="/js/vendor/jquery-1.9.1.js"></script>

    <!-- Also note that the type='text/javascript' is no longer needed as it's now the default -->
    <script src="/js/app.js"></script>

    <!-- Just a page heading - nothing special -->

<!--
    This is a 'button' that we will capture click events for using jquery. When the user clicks
    the 'button' the code in app.js will make an ajax call to our server requesting some data to
    be displayed. This 'button' is only here to facilitate manual starting of the ajax request.
-->
    <div ID='C1'>Click to load json</div>


<!--
    An empty div element that will be used to contain the data returned via ajax. This div will
    have the data inserted using jquery standard dom manipulation functions.

    Inserting ajax returned data 'into' an existing element is by no means the only way of
    displaying such returned data to the user. We could, for instance inject a whole new element
    into the DOM and not need an empty placeholder at all.

    I personally like to have the empty placeholders whenever possible as they provide a degree
    of self documentation to the html code. This can be very helpful once a site is split into
    multiple template fragments and so on.
